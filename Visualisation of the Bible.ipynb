    "1. *Tokenization*:\n",
    "Tokenization refers to dividing text or a sentence into a sequence of tokens, which roughly correspond to “words”. This is one of the basic tasks of NLP. \n",
    "2. *Noun Phrase Extraction*: \n",
    "Since we extracted the words in the previous section, instead of that we can just extract out the noun phrases from the textblob. Noun Phrase extraction is particularly important when you want to analyse the “who” in a sentence. Let's see an example below.\n",
    "3. *Part-of-speech Tagging*: \n",
    "Part-of-speech tagging or grammatical tagging is a method to mark words present in a text based on its definition and context. In simple words, it tells whether a word is a noun, or an adjective, or a verb, etc. This is just a complete version of noun phrase extraction, where we want to find all the parts of speech in a sentence.\n",
    "4. *Sentiment Analysis*: \n",
    "Sentiment analysis is basically the process of determining the attitude or the emotion of the writer, i.e., whether it is positive or negative or neutral.\n",
    "The sentiment function of textblob returns two properties, polarity, and subjectivity.\n",
    "Polarity is float which lies in the range of [-1,1] where 1 means positive statement and -1 means a negative statement. Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgement, whereas objective refers to factual information. Subjectivity is also a float which lies in the range of [0,1]."

Of course, it is obvious that there are also several blue squares in the triangle, which represents the negative correlation between the chapters. This proves that after calculation by the TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity algorithm, we believe that there is a negative correlation between the chapters, which only proves that there is little keywords in the chapters are particularly similar."
